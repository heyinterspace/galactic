# Cosmograph

An immersive 3D website (cosmograph.space) that visualizes the lifetime scientific work of any researcher as an explorable galaxy — research domains as suns, papers as orbiting planets, co-authors as moons. Originally built as a Father's Day gift for Dr. Mahendra S. Rao, it is now a reusable, open-source template: point it at any scientist (a dad, a mom, a mentor, yourself) and regenerate the data snapshot. The app ships with **no hardcoded identity** — everything the UI shows comes from the generated snapshot.

## Make it for your own scientist

1. Regenerate the snapshot for the person you want (by name or OpenAlex author ID):
   - `pnpm --filter @workspace/cosmograph run fetch:galaxy -- --name "Ada Lovelace" > artifacts/cosmograph/src/data/galaxyData.json`
   - or `... -- --id A5111365293 > artifacts/cosmograph/src/data/galaxyData.json`
   - Tip: name search prints the top OpenAlex matches to stderr; if it picks the wrong person, re-run with the correct `--id`.
2. That's it — restart the `galaxy` workflow. The title, stats, domains, papers, and co-authors all redraw from the new snapshot.

### When OpenAlex merged a *different* same-named researcher into the profile

OpenAlex sometimes lumps two distinct scientists who share a name under one author id. The fetch script can drop the wrong person's works (and then recomputes all headline stats — works, citations, h-index, i10, counts-by-year, institution — from only the kept works):

- `--exclude-institution <OpenAlexInstId>` — drop works affiliated with this institution (repeatable)
- `--exclude-coauthor <OpenAlexAuthorId>` — drop works co-authored with this person (repeatable)
- `--min-year <YYYY>` / `--max-year <YYYY>` — drop works outside this publication-year range
- Env equivalents: `GALAXY_EXCLUDE_INSTITUTIONS`, `GALAXY_EXCLUDE_COAUTHORS` (comma-separated), `GALAXY_MIN_YEAR`, `GALAXY_MAX_YEAR`

The shipped snapshot for **Mahendra S. Rao** uses this — profile `A5111365293` merged a Northwestern carcinogenesis/peroxisome researcher (Janardan K. Reddy's lab) with the real stem-cell scientist. The exact command that produced the current snapshot:

```
pnpm --filter @workspace/cosmograph run fetch:galaxy -- \
  --id A5111365293 \
  --exclude-institution I111979921 \
  --exclude-coauthor A5034754078 \
  --min-year 1994 \
  > artifacts/cosmograph/src/data/galaxyData.json
```

Disambiguate by research cluster (institution + co-author), **not** by year alone — the wrong person here published into the 2000s, so a plain year cutoff would not separate them.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string
- Optional env: `GITHUB_REPO` — `owner/repo` for the footer star count (default `heyinterspace/galactic`)

## Realtime presence (api-server)

- `api-server` hosts an ephemeral multiplayer presence layer: a WebSocket at `/api/presence` (`src/presence/server.ts`) streams each visitor's camera position so others see faint "wisps" and a live headcount ("N cosmonauts streaming now"). Nothing is persisted — anonymous, in-memory only.
- It also serves `/api/github/stars` (`src/routes/github.ts`), a 5-min TTL in-memory cache of the repo star count, so upstream GitHub is hit at most once per TTL regardless of traffic.
- **Abuse/DDoS guards** (tune in `src/presence/server.ts`): total + per-IP connection caps, handshake-rate limit, 256-byte `maxPayload`, per-socket token bucket, heartbeat reaping, coordinate clamping, and a 10 Hz shared-snapshot broadcast capped at 60 render peers. REST has a 120 req/min/IP limiter (`app.ts`); `trust proxy` is set to `1` for the single Replit proxy hop.
- **Deployment:** `api-server` must run as an always-on **Reserved VM** deployment, not a static/scale-to-zero (autoscale) one. Two things now depend on a long-lived process: the in-memory presence WebSocket **and** the paid-unlock layer (`/api/stripe/webhook`, `/api/me/entitlement`, `/api/billing/checkout`). On autoscale the webhook + presence are unreachable and paid unlocks silently fail. The galaxy itself is still static and works without it.
  - **The deployment type is set in the Publishing/Deployments pane, not in code.** `.replit` currently has `deploymentTarget = "autoscale"` and the agent cannot edit `.replit` — when publishing, switch the deployment type to **Reserved VM** in the Publishing pane. The api-server `artifact.toml` is already configured for it (production `run`, `build`, and `/api/healthz` startup probe).
  - **Stripe moves from sandbox to live on deploy.** On boot `initStripe()` finds-or-creates the managed webhook against the first host in `REPLIT_DOMAINS` (the production domain in prod), so the live webhook binds automatically — no manual webhook URL setup. Make sure the production Stripe connection/keys are the live ones before/after the first publish.

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- `artifacts/cosmograph/` — the Galaxy web app (React + Vite + React Three Fiber). Served at `/`.
- `artifacts/cosmograph/src/data/galaxyData.json` — the baked-in data snapshot (source of truth for the visualization).
- `artifacts/cosmograph/src/data/galaxy.ts` — typed accessors over the snapshot.
- `artifacts/cosmograph/scripts/fetch-galaxy.mjs` — one-time script that regenerates the snapshot from OpenAlex.

## Architecture decisions

- Data comes from **OpenAlex** (free, no API key), not Google Scholar (which has no public API).
- The full dataset is **fetched once at build time and baked into a static JSON file** — no backend, no database, no runtime calls for the core visualization. Keeps the gift fast and reliable.
- **Realtime presence + GitHub stars** are an *optional* enhancement served by the always-on `api-server`, not the static galaxy bundle. The galaxy degrades gracefully: if `/api/presence` is unreachable no wisps/headcount appear, and if `/api/github/stars` fails the footer button still links to the repo. The core galaxy never depends on the server being up.
- Research domains ("suns") are derived automatically from OpenAlex's topic hierarchy at the subfield level, with long-tail subfields collapsed into a "Cross-Disciplinary" sun (target ~6–12 suns).
- 3D rendering via React Three Fiber + drei + postprocessing.

## Product

- A single immersive 3D page: research domains are suns, papers are orbiting planets (size = citations, orbit distance = topic relevance), co-authors are moons.
- Two navigation modes: a spaceship fly-through and a god/planetarium orbit view with adjustable axis.
- Click planets/suns for paper and domain details; a stats layer summarizes the whole corpus.
- To regenerate the data snapshot for a different scientist, see "Make it for your own scientist" at the top of this file. The script takes `--name "Full Name"` or `--id <OpenAlexAuthorId>` (or `GALAXY_AUTHOR_NAME` / `GALAXY_AUTHOR_ID` env vars) and writes JSON to stdout.

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

- **Presence wisps live inside the tilt frame.** Peers send camera positions in galaxy-*local* space (the broadcaster un-rotates by `-galaxyTilt` about X before sending), and `PresenceWisps` re-applies `rotation-x={galaxyTilt}` so wisps line up with the orbiting planets for each viewer. Skip either half and wisps drift off the disk.
- **`api-server` must be always-on (Reserved VM) for presence AND paid unlocks.** Don't deploy it as static/scale-to-zero (autoscale) — the presence WebSocket needs a persistent process, and the Stripe webhook + entitlement endpoints must stay reachable or purchases silently fail. The deployment type is chosen in the Publishing pane (the agent can't edit `.replit`), not in `artifact.toml`. The galaxy bundle stays static and degrades gracefully if the server is down.
- **One remaining `pnpm audit` LOW is intentional:** esbuild `0.27.3` (Windows-only dev-server file read, GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr). It's a build tool not shipped in production and bumping to 0.28.x risks a Vite↔esbuild range mismatch. Leave it pinned.
- **Artifact `id` intentionally stays `artifacts/galaxy`.** The web app's folder/package were renamed `galaxy`→`cosmograph`, but the artifact `id` in `artifacts/cosmograph/.replit-artifact/artifact.toml` remains `artifacts/galaxy` because `verifyAndReplaceArtifactToml` rejects id changes (`INVALID_ARTIFACT_ID`). It's an internal, never-user-visible handle; everything else (dir, `@workspace/cosmograph`, build/publicDir, workflow) points at `cosmograph`. Don't "fix" the id mismatch unless the platform adds id migration.
- **Known doc gaps (not blockers):** repo has no `LICENSE` file despite being described as open-source, and `scripts/fetch-galaxy.mjs` still uses a placeholder OpenAlex `mailto`. Add a license and a real contact email before a public launch.
